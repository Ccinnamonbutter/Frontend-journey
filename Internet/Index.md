# INTERNET AND ITS ANATOMY

## INTRODUCTION
  The internet is an international network of connected computers,the word internetted was being used in the 1894 which means interwoven or inter connected.   
  The main purpose for connecting computers together is for easy access or sharing of information across a mirafge of connected computers, there are several ways information can be shared including: emails(POP3/IMAP/SMTP), file transfer (FTP), secure shell (SSH), and many more specialized modes upon which 
the internet is built.
    These standardized methods for transferring data or documents over a network are known as protocols. In other words protocols  define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control for data communication.The Web ( World Wide Web, thus the “www” in site addresses) is  one of the ways information can be shared over the internet. It is unique in that it allows documents to be linked to one another via hypertext links—thus forming a huge “web” of connected information. The web 
uses a protocol called  **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**.

### HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
  HTTP is a protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers on the internet. it follows a client-server model where clients send requests to servers, which respond with the requested data. HTTP  uses methods like GET, HEAD, PUT and POST to perform actions, and includes status Codes to indicate request success or failure. Https  als provides encrytion for secure and effective communication.
  hypertext is a fundamental protocol that enables effective communication between consumers and servers on the internet,facilitating the transfer of web resources.

  ## Domain Name 
   Now i know we have all seen on our browers or through search engines names accompanied with a **.com** like *Bigdadadyjoe.com*.This is called a domain name system which was created because the "Internet protocol numbering system" was just not convenient enough,
  A domain name is a readable address that represents a unique location on the internet, which serves as a reference point for identifying and accessing websites, resources, or services on the World Wide Web. Domain names are used to translate numeric IP addresses (such as 191.0.1.3) into easily memorizable words or phrases to make it simpler for users to navigate the internet. They typically consist of two main parts: the top-level domain (TLD) and the second-level domain. For example, in "example.com," "example" is the second-level domain, and ".com" is the top-level domain. Domain names are registered and managed by domain registrars, and they must be unique to ensure no two websites have the same domain name.
