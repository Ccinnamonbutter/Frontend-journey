# INTERNET AND ITS ANATOMY

## Introduction
  The internet is an international network of connected computers,the word internetted was being used in the 1894 which means interwoven or inter connected.   
  The main purpose for connecting computers together is for easy access or sharing of information across a mirafge of connected computers, there are several ways information can be shared including: emails(POP3/IMAP/SMTP), file transfer (FTP), secure shell (SSH), and many more specialized modes upon which 
the internet is built.
    These standardized methods for transferring data or documents over a network are known as protocols. In other words protocols  define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control for data communication.The Web ( World Wide Web, thus the “www” in site addresses) is  one of the ways information can be shared over the internet. It is unique in that it allows documents to be linked to one another via hypertext links—thus forming a huge “web” of connected information. The web 
uses a protocol called  **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**.

### HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
  HTTP is a protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers on the internet. it follows a client-server model where clients send requests to servers, which respond with the requested data. HTTP  uses methods like GET, HEAD, PUT and POST to perform actions, and includes status Codes to indicate request success or failure. Https  als provides encrytion for secure and effective communication.
  hypertext is a fundamental protocol that enables effective communication between consumers and servers on the internet,facilitating the transfer of web resources.

  ## Domain Name 
   Now i know we have all seen on our browers or through search engines names accompanied with a **.com** like *Bigdadadyjoe.com*.This is called a domain name system which was created because the "Internet protocol numbering system" was just not convenient enough,
  A domain name is a readable address that represents a unique location on the internet, which serves as a reference point for identifying and accessing websites, resources, or services on the World Wide Web. Domain names are used to translate numeric IP addresses (such as 191.0.1.3) into easily memorizable words or phrases to make it simpler for users to navigate the internet. They typically consist of two main parts: the top-level domain (TLD) and the second-level domain. For example, in "example.com," "example" is the second-level domain, and ".com" is the top-level domain. Domain names are registered and managed by domain registrars, and they must be unique to ensure no two websites have the same domain name.

   ##  Hosting
  Hosting, in the context of websites and web services, refers to the practice of storing and making web content, files, and applications accessible on servers that are connected to the internet. When you create a website or web application, you need a place to store the files and data that make up your site, and hosting provides that space on a server that is accessible to users worldwide.

## DNS(Domain Name System)
 The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed name service that provides a naming system for computers, services, and other resources on the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It associates various information with domain names (identification strings) assigned to each of the associated entities.
 ###   How it works
 When you enter a domain name into your browser;
 1. Your computer checks its local DNS cache to see if it has the corresponding IP stored.
 2. Then a query is sent to the DNS resolver
 3. The DNS resolver recursively queries the heirarchy, starting with the root servers, then TLD servers and authoritattive name servers for the specific domain.
 4. Updates are made throught registrsrs or hosting providers.

## Browsers
A browser  is a software application that acts as a user interface to access information on the World Wide Web.
     The software that does the requesting is called the client. 
People use desktop browsers, mobile browsers, and other assistive technologies (such as screen readers) as clients to access documents on the web. The  server returns the documents for the browser (also referred to as the user agent in technical circles) to display. The requests and responses are handled via the HTTP protocol, mentioned earlier.It is common to think of a browser as a window on a computer monitor with a web page displayed in it. These are known as graphical browsers or 
desktop browsers. The most popular desktop browsers as of this writing include Edge 
and Internet Explorer for Windows, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, with Opera 
and Vivaldi bringing up the rear.A browser serves as a gateway between users and the internet, providing a platform for navigating, viewing, and interacting with the world of information.

 ### How it works: Browser Rendering Engines
The program that is responsible for converting HTML and CSS into what you see rendered on the screen is called a rendering engine (also browser engine or layout engine). Browsers that you use on desktop computers and mobile devices are made up of rendering engines as well as other code used for their own user interfaces and functionality. Although I talk a lot about which browsers support particular functions in this book, I’m technically referring to the browser’s rendering engine. Various browsers often share a rendering engine; for example, the Blink engine powers Chrome, Opera, and a variety of Android 
browsers.
